# Itermusing

Since 2001, Brian and I have been dreaming, thinking, designing, building,
avoiding, and otherwise circling the topic of how to pragmatically collect
thoughts about technology, projects, personal interests, and more. In essence,
how to remember for the long term. Our desires have outlived many product
offerings and many more technology trends. Through it all, the web platform has
grown more capable and long lasting. Open Source and Open Standards are only
proven mechanisms capable of safeguarding content against the erroding forces
of time. Decades from now I want to be able to share my body of work with others;
as it is now, our creations are likely to be locked behind abandoned products,
acquired or failed companies, changed priorities, antiquated technologies
(CDs, Zip Drives, or floppy disks), or cloud hosting we can no longer afford.

Over the years, we have talked about this product concept under the names
"Syncromatic" and "Continuum App", collecting many notes, designs,
diagrams, and code sketches. During the global COVID Pandemic of 2020, I
was able to focus some of my free time into creating several supporting
Open Source libraries including PHORBAS Opaque, Store, and HAMT, among
others.  Pursuing our concept once again, we are starting work under the
PHORBAS project with the name "Itermusing", giving a digital place of
pasture for the paths your musings lead you down.

## Get Started

```sh
npm ci

# Continuously build ./esm library (using one console window)
npm run watch

# Run development website (using another console window)
npm run vite

# Build the ./esm library and the ./dist website
npm run build
```
